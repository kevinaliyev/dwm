This is my personal build of dwm for cloning and deployment. Original source: https://git.suckless.org/dwm/

this build requires pywal16 to compile, including a pywal colorscheme initialized, along with an xresources merge script in .xinitrc

otherwise this build will not compile / look right / function right



# this build is broken and i do not recommend using it in its current state !
